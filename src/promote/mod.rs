//! Promote & Certify: the final "Evolve -> Certify" stage. It takes an
//! accepted fix proposal, issues a proof certificate, and - only within the
//! bounds of `.navin/evolve.toml` - lands the change on a dedicated git
//! branch (optionally fast-forward merged), recording everything so it can
//! be rolled back with one command. Safe mode never merges automatically.
